Xenia is an EVM-based platform on AIA network enabling users to create, validate, and redeem gift cards securely and transparently. Using cryptographic hashing, the contract ensures that gift cards are unique, tamper-proof, and securely redeemable by recipients.

## 🌐 Features

- **Secure Gift Card Creation**: Issue gift cards with unique, hashed codes to protect against unauthorized use.
- **Redeemable by Recipients**: Only valid, unredeemed gift cards can be redeemed.
- **Full Validation**: Validate gift cards and verify if they exist or have already been redeemed.
- **Retrieve Created Cards**: Easily fetch all gift cards issued by a specific address.
- **Transparent Blockchain Transactions**: All interactions are transparent, recorded on-chain, and easily verifiable.
